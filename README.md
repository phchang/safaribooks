# safaribooks

If you're like me and like to highlight text while reading online, especially on Safari Books, then add this as a global stylesheet to your browser. If you include this stylesheet (or append the contents to an existing style sheet), it will hide the pop-up box via CSS.

To make this work in Safari, go to Preferences > Advanced and add the safari-css.css as shown.
